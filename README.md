# 🏅 2008 Olympic Medalists - Tidy Data Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and visualizing the 2008 Olympic medalist dataset using **tidy data principles**. The raw dataset contains unstructured information, requiring transformations to make it easier to analyze.

### **What is Tidy Data?**
Tidy data follows three key principles:
1. **Each variable** forms its own **column**.
2. **Each observation** forms its own **row**.
3. **Each value** belongs to its respective **cell**.

By applying these principles, we transform messy data into a structured format suitable for analysis and visualization.
